# Minecraft 1.19.3 World: DES S-Box Redstone Contraption
Welcome to the README file for the Minecraft 1.19.3 world featuring a redstone contraption that computes the S-box transformation of DES encryption.

### Overview
This world features a redstone contraption that calculates the S-box transformation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher. The DES cipher is a symmetric-key block cipher that was widely used for secure data transmission. The S-box (substitution box) is a vital part of the DES encryption process, taking the input and substituting it with corresponding output values from a predefined lookup table.
